    "# Train, deploy and monitor a XGBoost regression model with the Amazon SageMaker and alert using AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) is a fully managed machine learning service. With SageMaker, you have the option of using the built-in algorithms or you can bring your own algorithms and frameworks. One of the features offered by Amazon SageMaker is [Model Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-monitor.html) which continuously monitors the quality of Amazon SageMaker machine learning models in production. With Model Monitor, you can set alerts that notify you when there are deviations from the specified baseline for the specified monitoring type. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the SageMaker's [built-in XGBoost algorithm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/xgboost.html) to train a regression model on the [California Housing dataset](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html), deploy it on a SageMaker inference endpoint and monitor using SageMaker Model Monitor.  Of the various monitoring types supported by the Model Monitor, we will demonstrate [Data Quality Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-monitor-data-quality.html) and [Model Quality Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-monitor-model-quality.html) in this notebook.  When you complete running through all the steps in this notebook, you will notice both Data Quality and Model Quality violations assuming you have not changed the data or the processing logic.  Finally, this notebook will provide an overview of the process involved in setting up alerting using [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [Amazon SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns) to send out e-mail or text based alerts.  A code sample for the Lambda function is also included.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Data Quality Monitor, you can detect data quality drift by tracking the difference between data that was used to train the models versus the data that is being presented to the model to score.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Model Quality Monitor, you can monitor model characteristics (such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, R2, precision, accuracy, recall and more) of your ML models in real time.  SageMaker Model monitor reports how well a ML model is predicting outcomes by comparing model prediction to ground truth data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* This notebook should only be run from within a SageMaker notebook instance as it references SageMaker native APIs.\n",
    "* At the time of writing this notebook, the most relevant latest version of the Jupyter notebook kernel for this notebook was `conda_python3` and this came built-in with SageMaker notebooks.\n",
    "* This notebook uses CPU based instances for training.\n",
    "* This notebook will create resources in the same AWS account and in the same region where this notebook is running.\n",
